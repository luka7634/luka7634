# **Hi there, I'm Luka ✌️**
### 🚀 Developer/Student

**Currently Working on: Being better with C/C++ (and figuring out how to stop talking to my code like it can hear me)**

**Soft Skills:**
> High level of english comprehension
>
> I know how to work in team (as long as I get to be the one who brings snacks)
>
> Excellent communication skills (I can explain complex concepts without using too many acronyms)
> 
> Strong problem-solving abilities (I can troubleshoot both code and my life)

**HABILITIES:**
* Python: ['Kivy', 'Tkinter', 'OS', 'Array Manipulation', 'POO', 'Sorting Algorithms', 'and sorting my life out, but that’s a work in progress']
* C/C++ = {

  Competitive Programming on DMOJ -> Link to my [profile](https://dmoj.uclv.edu.cu/user/Roybel878)

  I participated on [II UCI Programming Cup for High School Students](https://dmoj.uclv.edu.cu/contest/2copauci), obtainig 290 points and bronze medal

  Currently solved +30 problems/exercises between competitions and my [DMOJ PERSONAL PROFILE](https://dmoj.uclv.edu.cu/user/Roybel878) (because who needs sleep when you have algorithms?)

  I know:

    * String manipulation

    * Structures

    * Functions

    * Recursion and Backtracking (which is basically my life story)

    * Graphs algorithms:
 
      > Build Graphs
      >
      > Build Segment-tree
      >
      > DFS -> Depth First Search
      >
      > BFS -> Breath First Search (which is how I approach my snack breaks)

};
